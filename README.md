**Cannon Game**
-------
__Overview__

This project is a retro-style artillery game, developed as the final exam project for the course "Computer programming, Algorithms, and Data Structures" at the University of Pavia. 
The player controls a cannon to fire projectiles at targets, considering various physics elements and interactions with obstacles.<br><br>

__Gameplay__

The player's objective is to hit a target by adjusting the angle and velocity of projectiles fired from a cannon, navigating through multiple levels of increasing difficulty, with a range of obstacles that affect gameplay.
